I am a **dynamic figure**, often seen **creating fake emails** to get more free trials and **solving imaginary problems** crafted by **Polish mathematicians**. When I am bored, I charm cats with my **transcendental clarinet squeaks**.

I am **motivated to take risks**. Sometimes, because I like to live dangerously, I play chess with **one less pawn** and do **geometry in pen**. Sometimes I even play the Wii without the safety strap! I know - I'm a real daredevil. Sometimes I'm even amazed myself that I've managed to survive this long in the first place, what with all these **totally dangerous** and not-at-all-normal feats! But nothing quite beats the adrenaline rush I get from **submitting code without compiling it locally**.

What many may find perplexing is St John's College's (frustrating) **inability to spell my 4-letter name**. However, this is simply one of many testaments to the fact that I simply **transcend the English language**. This is an elusive position shared only by **literally every other language** (except Javascript).

Who am I? Of course, I am...
